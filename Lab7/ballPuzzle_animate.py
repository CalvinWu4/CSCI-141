"""
This program animates the colored ball juggling puzzle.
It has an animate_init() function to create the initial
setup with all balls in the first (red) can.
Then it has an animate_move() function, which takes the list of
stacks as well as integers indicating the from and to stacks,
and moves the top ball appropriately.

NOTE:  students need to follow the interface for these functions,
that is provide the expected inputs to the functions, 
but do not need to change anything in the functions.
