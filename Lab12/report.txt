1. The purpose of the pivot is to choose a value on which to base the three partitions on. If the array
was already sorted, the algorithm would have run faster if we chose the middle value as the pivot each time due to
not having one partition being extremely larger than the rest.

2. Test Cases:
[]=Bad index
[1]=1
[1,1]=1
[1,2,3]=2
[1,2,3,4]=2.5
[1,3,2]=2
[4,2,1,3]=2.5

3. The elapsed time performance of my quick-select based median finding program when it processes a large data set is:
2.36 sec
5.39 sec
2.38 sec
1.84 sec
2.44 sec
1.77 sec
5.74 sec

The elapsed time performance of my selection sort based median program when it processes the same large data set is: 
33.33 sec
25.90 sec
25.55 sec
28.69 sec
30.89 sec
28.25 sec
31.37 sec
